# 🚦 Traffic Patterns Analysis

A machine learning project that simulates traffic data to predict congestion levels using logistic regression. Includes insightful visualizations of traffic behavior based on vehicle count, speed, and time of day.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses synthetic data to simulate urban traffic scenarios. It applies logistic regression to classify traffic congestion and visualizes key traffic patterns to support analysis and decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Simulate traffic data with relevant features.
* Define congestion based on vehicle count and speed.
* Train and evaluate a logistic regression model.
* Visualize traffic trends and congestion behavior.

---

## 📁 Data

The dataset is **synthetically generated** and includes:

* `vehicle_count`: Number of vehicles.
* `avg_speed`: Average speed (km/h).
* `time_of_day`: Hour of the day (0–23).

**Congestion Rule:**

* **High (1)** = vehicle count > 60 AND average speed < 30
* **Low (0)** = otherwise

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Libraries**:

  * `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation
  * `scikit-learn` – machine learning
  * `matplotlib` – visualizations

---

## 📊 Visualizations

* **Scatter Plot**: Vehicle count vs. average speed by congestion level
* **Line Plot**: Average congestion across hours of the day
* **Bar Chart**: Average vehicle count for high vs. low congestion

Each plot helps uncover trends in traffic conditions.
